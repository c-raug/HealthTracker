# HealthTracker — Product Requirements

## Phase 10: v1.0 Release Infrastructure [IN PROGRESS]

### 10.1 — EAS Build configuration for Android APK

No build configuration existed for producing a distributable Android APK. Added `eas.json` with a `preview` profile (`distribution: "internal"`, `buildType: "apk"`) for sideloadable APK builds and a `production` profile for future Play Store AAB builds. Added `build:preview` and `build:production` npm scripts.

**Changes:**
- `eas.json` *(new)*: EAS Build config with `preview` (APK) and `production` (AAB) profiles
- `package.json`: Added `build:preview` and `build:production` scripts

### 10.2 — Gate USDA food search behind environment variable

The USDA FoodData Central API integration has not been tested in production. To avoid shipping broken functionality in the v1.0 release, food search is gated behind `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_USDA_SEARCH`. When the variable is missing or not `"true"`, `searchFoods()` returns empty results immediately. Custom foods continue to work. All three consumers (`AddFoodTab`, `CreateMealFlow`, `EditMealFlow`) already handle empty USDA results gracefully.

**Changes:**
- `api/usdaFoodData.ts`: Added `USDA_ENABLED` constant; early return in `searchFoods()` when disabled

---

## Files Changed in Phase 10

- `eas.json` *(new)* — EAS Build configuration with preview APK and production AAB profiles
- `package.json` — Added `build:preview` and `build:production` scripts
- `api/usdaFoodData.ts` — Added `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_USDA_SEARCH` gate in `searchFoods()`

---

## Phase 9: Cross-Page Polish & Settings Overhaul [IN PROGRESS]

### 9.1 — "Go to Today" quick-nav pill

All three date-navigable screens (Weight, Nutrition, Activities) let users scroll arbitrarily far into the past with no fast path back to the current day. A small "Today" pill button should appear above the date navigation bar **only** when the selected date is not today. Tapping it snaps the selected date back to `getToday()` immediately.

**Changes:**
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`: Add `todayPill` / `todayPillText` styles. Render `{selectedDate !== today && <TouchableOpacity style={styles.todayPill} onPress={() => setSelectedDate(today)}><Text style={styles.todayPillText}>Today</Text></TouchableOpacity>}` directly above the `dateNav` View inside the `'log'` section.
- `app/(tabs)/nutrition.tsx`: Same pill pattern — add styles, render pill above the `dateNav` View when `selectedDate !== today`.
- `app/(tabs)/activities.tsx`: Same pill pattern — render above the `dateNav` View when `selectedDate !== today`.
- Style: small horizontally-centered rounded pill (`backgroundColor: colors.primaryLight`, `color: colors.primary`, `borderRadius: Radius.md`, `paddingVertical: 4`, `paddingHorizontal: Spacing.md`, `alignSelf: 'center'`, `marginBottom: Spacing.xs`).

### 9.2 — Weight chart: linear interpolation

The `<LineChart>` in `WeightChart.tsx` uses the `bezier` prop, which produces curved splines between points. This can visually imply values above or below the actual logged readings, misleading the user. Removing `bezier` makes the line a straight segment between each adjacent pair of data points.

**Changes:**
- `components/WeightChart.tsx`: Remove the `bezier` prop from `<LineChart>`.

### 9.3 — Weight insights card

After the chart, there is no summary of progress toward the user's weight goal. A new insights card should appear below `<WeightChart />` in the History view, showing:
1. **Total change in the last 7 days** — difference (in the user's preferred unit) between the most recent entry and the oldest entry within the past 7 calendar days.
2. **Estimated weekly rate** — the above change scaled to a per-week rate (change / days_span × 7).
3. **On-Track status badge** — compares the weekly rate against the target rate implied by `profile.weightGoal`:
   - Target rates (lbs/wk): `lose_2` = −2, `lose_1.5` = −1.5, `lose_1` = −1, `lose_0.5` = −0.5, `maintain` = 0, `gain_0.5` = +0.5, `gain_1` = +1, `gain_1.5` = +1.5, `gain_2` = +2.
   - **On Track** (green ✓): `|actual_rate − target_rate| ≤ 0.25 lbs/wk` (or `≤ 0.1 kg/wk` when unit is kg).
   - **Behind** (amber ⚠): actual rate is in the wrong direction or the gap is too large.
   - **Ahead** (amber ⚠): actual rate exceeds target by more than the tolerance (e.g. losing faster than intended).
   - If `< 2` entries exist in the last 7 days, or no weight goal is set (no profile), display a neutral placeholder: "Log more entries to see progress insights."

**Changes:**
- `components/WeightInsights.tsx` *(new)*: Reads `entries`, `preferences.unit`, and `preferences.profile.weightGoal`. Implements the logic above. Renders a card (`backgroundColor: colors.card`, `borderRadius: Radius.lg`, `padding: Spacing.md`, shadow) with a "Progress Insights" label, the change value + rate line, and a colored status badge row.
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`: Import and render `<WeightInsights />` below `<WeightChart />` inside the `'history'` section.

### 9.4 — CreateMealFlow: custom food tap resets selection (bug fix)

**Root cause:** `handleSelectItem` calls `Keyboard.dismiss()`, which triggers `onBlur` on the search `TextInput`, setting `searchFocused = false`. When `query` is also empty (no text typed), `isSearchMode` (`searchFocused || query.length > 0`) becomes `false`, switching the view to the "Foods in Meal" list and hiding the `PortionSelector` panel — even though `selectedItem` was just set.

On the second tap the user sees both the portion window and the keyboard simultaneously because keyboard re-focuses on tap, creating a broken state that forces them to cancel and restart.

**Fix:** Include `selectedItem !== null` in the `isSearchMode` guard so a selected item keeps the search-mode view alive regardless of focus state.

**Changes:**
- `components/nutrition/CreateMealFlow.tsx`: Change line `const isSearchMode = searchFocused || query.length > 0;` → `const isSearchMode = searchFocused || query.length > 0 || selectedItem !== null;`

### 9.5 — Activity page: keyboard doesn't dismiss on save

After the user enters steps or smartwatch calories via the keyboard and taps the save/add button, the keyboard stays open. `handleAddSteps` and `handleSaveSmartwatch` need to call `Keyboard.dismiss()` before their dispatch/logic so the keyboard closes on save.

**Changes:**
- `app/(tabs)/activities.tsx`: Add `import { Keyboard } from 'react-native'` (already imported via the existing import block — verify it's included). In `handleAddSteps`, call `Keyboard.dismiss()` before the `dispatch` call. In `handleSaveSmartwatch`, call `Keyboard.dismiss()` at the top of the function (before the early return guard).

### 9.6 — Settings page reorganization

The current Settings layout mixes biometric identity data (name, DOB, sex, height), goal/calorie settings (weight goal, activity level, activity mode, fitness goal), and display preferences (units) into an unintuitive order. Specifically: Activity Tracking mode sits between Profile and Macros despite being conceptually part of calorie-goal configuration; the Profile section is overlong; the About card adds noise.

**New section order:**
1. **Profile** (collapsible) — biometrics only: Name, DOB, Sex, Height.
2. **Goals & Calorie Target** (collapsible, new) — everything that affects the calorie calculation: Weight Goal, Activity Level, Activity Tracking Mode, Fitness Goal.
3. **Units** (non-collapsible card, moved up) — lbs/kg toggle.
4. **Macros** (collapsible) — unchanged.
5. **About** — removed as a card; replaced with a small plain `<Text>` footer at the bottom of the `ScrollView` showing `HealthTracker v1.0.0`.

**Changes:**
- `components/settings/ProfileSection.tsx`: Remove the Activity Level, Weight Goal, and Fitness Goal fields. The component retains only Name, DOB picker, Sex toggle, and Height input(s). Remove the `GOAL_LABELS`, `ACTIVITY_LABELS`, `ACTIVITY_INFO`, and associated handler/state (`activityLevel`, `weightGoal`, `fitnessGoal`, `infoModal` for activity, etc.). Remove the `activityMode` prop (no longer needed here).
- `components/settings/GoalsSection.tsx` *(new)*: Accepts props `activityMode: ActivityMode`, `goalCalories: number | null`, `onActivityModeChange: (mode: ActivityMode) => void`. Contains:
  - **Weight Goal** picker — dynamic labels based on `isImperial` (see 9.7).
  - **Activity Level** buttons — same greyed-out behaviour (opacity 0.4, non-tappable) when `activityMode !== 'auto'`; ⓘ info buttons opening `InfoModal`.
  - **Activity Tracking Mode** — the three pill buttons (Auto / Manual / Smart Watch) with ⓘ buttons and banner (moved from `settings.tsx` inline block).
  - **Fitness Goal** text input.
  - Dispatches `SET_PROFILE` for weight goal, activity level, fitness goal changes; calls `onActivityModeChange` for mode changes.
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`: Remove the `activityModeExpanded` state and the "Activity Tracking" collapsible card. Add `goalsExpanded` state (default `true`). Add a new "Goals & Calorie Target" collapsible card that renders `<GoalsSection activityMode={activityMode} goalCalories={goalCalories} onActivityModeChange={setActivityMode} />`. Move the Units card above the Macros card. Remove the About card; add `<Text style={styles.footer}>HealthTracker v1.0.0</Text>` at the bottom of the `ScrollView`. Update `ProfileSection` — remove `activityMode` prop.

### 9.7 — Expanded weight goal options (±2 lbs in 0.5 lb steps)

Currently only 5 weight goal presets exist (lose 1, lose 0.5, maintain, gain 0.5, gain 1). The full ±2 lb range in 0.5 lb increments requires 9 options. When the user's unit is `kg`, labels show the kg equivalent.

**Target rate → daily calorie offset mapping:**
| Goal | Cal offset |
|------|-----------|
| lose_2 | −1000 |
| lose_1.5 | −750 |
| lose_1 | −500 |
| lose_0.5 | −250 |
| maintain | 0 |
| gain_0.5 | +250 |
| gain_1 | +500 |
| gain_1.5 | +750 |
| gain_2 | +1000 |

**Label mapping (lbs / kg):**
| Value | lbs label | kg label |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| lose_2 | Lose 2 lb/wk | Lose 0.9 kg/wk |
| lose_1.5 | Lose 1.5 lb/wk | Lose 0.7 kg/wk |
| lose_1 | Lose 1 lb/wk | Lose 0.5 kg/wk |
| lose_0.5 | Lose 0.5 lb/wk | Lose 0.25 kg/wk |
| maintain | Maintain | Maintain |
| gain_0.5 | Gain 0.5 lb/wk | Gain 0.25 kg/wk |
| gain_1 | Gain 1 lb/wk | Gain 0.5 kg/wk |
| gain_1.5 | Gain 1.5 lb/wk | Gain 0.7 kg/wk |
| gain_2 | Gain 2 lb/wk | Gain 0.9 kg/wk |

**Changes:**
- `types/index.ts`: Expand `WeightGoal` union to add `'lose_2' | 'lose_1.5' | 'gain_1.5' | 'gain_2'`.
- `utils/tdeeCalculation.ts`: Add four new cases to `getGoalCalories` switch: `lose_2` (−1000), `lose_1.5` (−750), `gain_1.5` (+750), `gain_2` (+1000).
- `components/settings/GoalsSection.tsx`: Build `GOAL_LABELS` dynamically from `isImperial` using the table above. Render all 9 options in the weight goal picker grid.

## Phase 7: Nutrition & Weight UX Improvements [IN PROGRESS]

### 7.1 — Portion selection when building meal templates

When creating a saved meal in the "Create New Meal" flow (`CreateMealFlow.tsx`), tapping a food from the search results previously added it immediately at 1 serving with no opportunity to choose portions. This should match the behavior in `AddFoodTab`:

- Tapping a food result selects it and reveals a `PortionSelector` panel below the search results.
- The user adjusts servings (whole + fraction drums or keypad), seeing a live macro preview.
- An "Add to Meal" button confirms the selection, scaling calories/macros by the chosen portion before appending the food to the meal list.
- After confirming, the search query clears and the portion panel hides, ready for the next food.

### 7.2 — Food search results disappear when typing

**Root cause:** In `AddFoodTab.tsx`, the render is `loading ? <ActivityIndicator> : <FlatList>`. When the user types 2+ characters, the 300ms debounce fires, sets `loading=true`, and the entire FlatList is replaced by a spinner — including matching custom foods that don't require an API call.

**Fix:** Decouple the spinner from the list. The ActivityIndicator is shown as a small inline indicator (above the list), and the FlatList always renders when results are available. Custom food matches remain visible during the USDA API loading phase.

### 7.3 — Edit saved meal templates

No edit UI exists for saved meal templates despite `UPDATE_SAVED_MEAL` already being handled in the reducer.

**Changes:**
- `AddMealTab.tsx`: Add a pencil (`pencil-outline`) icon button next to the existing delete (trash) button on each saved meal row. Tapping it opens `EditMealFlow`.
- `EditMealFlow.tsx` (new): Same search + PortionSelector flow as CreateMealFlow, but pre-populated with the meal's existing name and foods. Existing foods in the meal can be removed (×) or have their portion adjusted (tap to open an inline PortionSelector). On save, dispatches `UPDATE_SAVED_MEAL`.

**Also covers daily meal editing note:** Individual food items in daily meals are already editable — tap a food to adjust portions via PortionSelector bottom sheet, swipe to delete, tap + to add foods. No changes needed there.

### 7.4 — Keyboard dismissal after saving a weight

After the user taps "Save Entry" on the Weight tab, the keyboard remains visible behind the success Alert. Fix: call `Keyboard.dismiss()` in `handleSave()` (in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) immediately before the `Alert.alert('Saved', ...)` call on the success path.

### 7.5 — Reduce custom food unit picker options

In `CustomFoodForm`, trim the serving-unit chip row from 7 options (`Serving`, `g`, `oz`, `ml`, `Cup`, `Tbsp`, `Tsp`) down to 3 (`g`, `oz`, `qty`). Default selection changes to `g`. The stored `servingSize` string format is unchanged.

### 7.6 — Create Meal search view: hide meal list while searching

In `CreateMealFlow`, introduce a `searchFocused` boolean state wired to `onFocus`/`onBlur` on the search TextInput. When `searchFocused || query.length > 0` (search mode), the "Foods in Meal" list is hidden and the search results FlatList expands to `flex: 1`, filling the space between the header and the always-visible Cancel/Save Meal buttons. When the search input is blurred and the query is empty (browse mode), the Foods in Meal list is shown instead. After confirming a food portion, `handleSearch('')` is called to repopulate custom foods so the user can immediately search again.

### 7.7 — Dismiss keyboard on food selection in Add Food tab

In `AddFoodTab`, call `Keyboard.dismiss()` immediately when the user taps a food result row, so the keyboard closes before the PortionSelector drum pickers appear.

### 7.8 — Compact drum pickers and scrollable portion editor bottom sheet

`PortionSelector`: Reduced `VISIBLE_ITEMS` from 5 to 3, shrinking each drum from 220 px to 132 px. `FoodItem`: The portion-edit bottom sheet (`editSheet`) now has `maxHeight: '85%'` to prevent overflow on small screens. The PortionSelector and Update Portion button are wrapped in a `ScrollView` (with `paddingBottom` for safe-area clearance) so the button is always reachable.

---

## Phase 8: Profile & Activity Tracking Overhaul [IN PROGRESS]

### 8.1 — Enhanced Profile Form

The profile form only captured age, sex, height, activity level, and weight goal. Added name (optional), date of birth replacing the age input (age auto-updates yearly via `ageFromDob()`), and a freeform fitness goal field.

**Changes:**
- `types/index.ts`: Added `name?: string`, `dob?: string`, `fitnessGoal?: string` to `UserProfile`; kept `age?: number` for backward compat with existing stored data
- `utils/tdeeCalculation.ts`: Added `ageFromDob(dob: string): number` helper; updated all TDEE call sites to use `dob ? ageFromDob(dob) : age ?? 30`
- `components/settings/ProfileSection.tsx`: Added Name TextInput at top; replaced Age TextInput with DOB date picker (DateTimePicker + iOS bottom-sheet Modal); added Fitness Goal TextInput after weight goal; updated `buildAndSave` signature and state vars

### 8.2 — Activity Tracking Mode (Auto / Manual / Smart Watch)

All logged activities previously always added to the nutrition calorie target, causing double-counting for users who selected an activity level for TDEE. A mode selector was added to Settings.

**Changes:**
- `types/index.ts`: Added `ActivityMode = 'auto' | 'manual' | 'smartwatch'`; added `activityMode?: ActivityMode` to `UserPreferences`; extended `ActivityEntry.type` to include `'smartwatch'`
- `context/AppContext.tsx`: Added `SET_ACTIVITY_MODE` action and reducer case
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`: Added new collapsible "Activity Tracking" card between Profile and Macros; three pill buttons (Auto / Manual / Smart Watch) each with an ⓘ info button; warning/info banners below; passes `activityMode` prop to `ProfileSection`
- `components/settings/ProfileSection.tsx`: Accepts `activityMode` prop; shows activity level buttons at 0.4 opacity (non-tappable) with a note when mode is Manual or Smart Watch
- `utils/tdeeCalculation.ts`: Added `activityMode` param (default `'manual'`); when not `'auto'`, overrides activity multiplier with sedentary (×1.2)
- `app/(tabs)/nutrition.tsx`: Reads `activityMode`; skips activity calories when `'auto'`; sums only smartwatch entries when `'smartwatch'`; updates TDEE call with resolved age and mode
- `app/(tabs)/activities.tsx`: Reads `activityMode`; shows warning banner in `'auto'` mode with grayed calorie figures labeled "ref"; replaces exercise/steps sections with smartwatch calorie input when `'smartwatch'`; pre-fills smartwatch input from existing entry

### 8.3 — Info Buttons ("ⓘ") Throughout

No info/help context existed anywhere. Added contextual info buttons for activity modes and activity levels.

**Changes:**
- `components/InfoModal.tsx` *(new)*: Reusable transparent-overlay modal. Props: `visible`, `title`, `description`, `onClose`. Fade animation, centered card, "Got it" close button.
- `components/settings/ProfileSection.tsx`: ⓘ icon next to each Activity Level button. Tapping opens InfoModal with level description and multiplier.
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`: ⓘ icon next to each Activity Mode pill. Tapping opens InfoModal with mode description.

### 8.4 — Weight Save: Inline Confirmation Instead of Alert Popup

After saving a weight entry the app showed `Alert.alert('Saved', ...)`. Replaced with an inline message below the save button.

**Changes:**
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`: Removed `Alert.alert('Saved', ...)`. Added `savedMessage: string | null` state. After dispatch, sets message to "Weight saved on [Weekday, Month Day] at [H:MM AM/PM]". Auto-clears via `setTimeout` after 3.5 s. Clears when user starts typing. Rendered below save button in primary-colored italic small text.
